        "Text": "Palleon nasus nasus is endemic to Ekongo, south-eastern Madagascar, and its geological type locality is Ekongo, southeastern Madagascar. P. n. pauliani is only known from its type locality of Manjarivolo, l’Andringitra, Madagascar. P. n. pauliani can be found at elevations between 1,620 and 1,650 m (5,310 and 5,410 ft) above mean sea level.[2] P. nasus was listed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species, as it can be found over an area of 15,798 km2 (6,100 sq mi), but the quality and extent of the humid forest where the species needs to live is in a continuous decline, mainly due to mining, logging (for charcoal), and the slash-and-burn method in agriculture.[3] P. n. nasus is found in some strictly protected areas and reserves, meaning it should not be harmed too much.[3]",

The size and appearance of this chameleon varies considerably over its vast range, and it may be any shade of brown, beige, grey, olive, green, or dark red, but usually display colours and patterns that mimic a dead leaf. Despite its tiny size, the brown leaf chameleon has an imposing appearance due to two pronounced horns that protrude from the head above each eye and four spiny scales that jut from the throat.[1]",
